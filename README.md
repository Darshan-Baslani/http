# Go HTTP Project

This project is a work in progress. The goal is to build a fully functional HTTP server from scratch using Go.

## Project Goal

When complete, this project will be a standard HTTP server capable of handling requests, routing, and serving responses. This project serves as a deep dive into the underlying concepts of the HTTP protocol and web servers.

## Learnings

- Understanding the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol.
- Implementing TCP listeners and handling raw TCP connections.
- Parsing HTTP requests and constructing valid HTTP responses.
- Exploring Go's networking packages and concurrency features.

## Why Go?

Go is an excellent choice for this project due to its strong support for networking, built-in concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels), and performance. Its simplicity and powerful standard library make it ideal for building efficient and scalable network services.
